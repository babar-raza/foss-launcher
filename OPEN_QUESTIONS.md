# Open Questions

This file tracks unresolved questions that require user/stakeholder clarification before implementation proceeds.

## How to use this file
- If an implementation agent encounters ambiguity that would require guessing, they MUST:
  1) Write a blocker issue JSON (see `plans/taskcards/00_TASKCARD_CONTRACT.md`), and
  2) Add (or update) an entry here that links to the ambiguous doc section and the blocker artifact.
- Keep questions **actionable** and **scoped**. Prefer one question per entry.

## Format

Each question should include:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (OQ-###)
- **Category**: Area of concern (specs/plans/architecture/requirements)
- **Question**: Clear question statement
- **Impact**: What is blocked or affected
- **Date Added**: When question was raised
- **Status**: OPEN | ANSWERED | DEFERRED
- **Resolution**: Answer or decision (when status=ANSWERED)

## Current status

As of **2026-01-22**, there are **no recorded open questions** in this repo.

> If you believe items are still unresolved, add them below (do not keep "gaps" only in reports — this file is the canonical place for unanswered questions).
