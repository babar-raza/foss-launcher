# Implementation Plans (LLM-ready)

This folder contains **execution-ready prompts** and **taskcards** for an implementation agent workforce.

Rules:
- All implementation work must follow the binding specs under `specs/`.
- Every agent must write a report and 12-dimension self review under `reports/`.
- The orchestrator must perform a master review and either accept or return work for fixes.

Start with: `plans/00_orchestrator_master_prompt.md`.
