Define patterns to detect:\n   - GitHub tokens: ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}\n   - Bearer tokens: Bearer [A-Za-z0-9_-]+\n   - API keys: [A-Za-z0-9]{32,}\n   - Environment variable leaks: (TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)=[A-Za-z0-9]+\n2. Scan runs/**/logs/**, runs/**/reports/**, runs/**/artifacts/**\n3. Report all findings with file path and line number\n4. Exit code 1 if any secrets found\n5. Add tests in tests/unit/test_secrets_scanner.py\n6. Reference TC-590 (security and secrets taskcard)",
