## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed Gate A2 and Gate B validation failures in TC-630, TC-631, and TC-632, achieving 21/21 gates PASS in validate_swarm_ready.py. All taskcard hygiene issues resolved.

---

## Commands Executed

### 1. Baseline Validation (Before Fixes)
```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/validate_swarm_ready.py > runs/phase_n0_pilot_e2e_exec_20260129_213408/logs/validate_swarm_ready_before_fix.txt 2>&1
```
**Result**: FAILURE - 2/21 gates failed (A2 and B)

### 2. Taskcard Fixes Applied
Created TC-633 taskcard and applied the following fixes:

**TC-630 (Golden capture):**
- Fixed status: `In Progress` → `In-Progress`
- Fixed spec ref: `specs/27_pilot_execution_model.md` → `specs/13_pilots.md`
- Added sections: Deliverables, Acceptance checks, Integration boundary proven, Self-review

**TC-631 (Offline PR manager):**
- Fixed status: `In Progress` → `In-Progress`
- Fixed spec ref: `specs/27_pilot_execution_model.md` → `specs/13_pilots.md`
- Removed line reference: `specs/21_worker_contracts.md:322-344` → `specs/21_worker_contracts.md`
- Added sections: Deliverables, Acceptance checks, Integration boundary proven, Self-review

**TC-632 (Config verification):**
- Fixed status: `In Progress` → `In-Progress`
- Added sections: Deliverables, Acceptance checks, Integration boundary proven, Self-review

**INDEX.md:**
- Added entries for TC-630, TC-631, TC-632, TC-633

### 3. Final Validation (After Fixes)
```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/validate_swarm_ready.py > runs/phase_n0_pilot_e2e_exec_20260129_213408/logs/validate_swarm_ready_after_tc633_final.txt 2>&1
```
**Result**: SUCCESS - 21/21 gates PASS ✓
