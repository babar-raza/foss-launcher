  "severity": "blocker",
  "message": "specs/00_overview.md requires batch execution (queue many runs) with bounded concurrency, but there is no binding spec section defining batch-run semantics (input shape, scheduling, CLI/MCP surface, resume model) and no taskcard explicitly covering batch-run orchestration. This creates ambiguity for implementation agents.",

  },
  "suggested_fix": "Add a binding spec section (or new spec) that defines: (1) how batch input is expressed (e.g., directory of run_config files, or list in a batch manifest), (2) concurrency semantics and determinism requirements for scheduling, (3) required queue/resume artifacts, and (4) CLI + MCP endpoints that expose batch execution. Then add/extend a taskcard (likely TC-300/TC-530) to implement those exact semantics with acceptance tests.",
