# Self Review (12-D)

> Agent: __AGENT_NAME__  
> Taskcard: __TASK_ID__  
> Date: __DATE__

## Summary
- What I changed:
- How to run verification (exact commands):
- Key risks / follow-ups:

## Evidence
- Diff summary (high level):
- Tests run (commands + results):
- Logs/artifacts written (paths):

## 12 Quality Dimensions (score 1–5)
For **each** dimension include:
- `Score: X/5`
- 3–8 bullets of evidence (or rationale for low confidence)

1) Correctness  
2) Completeness vs spec  
3) Determinism / reproducibility  
4) Robustness / error handling  
5) Test quality & coverage  
6) Maintainability  
7) Readability / clarity  
8) Performance  
9) Security / safety  
10) Observability (logging + telemetry)  
11) Integration (CLI/MCP parity, run_dir contracts)  
12) Minimality (no bloat, no hacks)

## Final verdict
- Ship / Needs changes:
- If needs changes: list exact TODOs and which agent/taskcard should address them.
- Any dimension <4 MUST include a concrete fix plan.
