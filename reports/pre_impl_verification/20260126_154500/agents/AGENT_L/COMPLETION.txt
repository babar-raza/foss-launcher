AGENT_L COMPLETION SUMMARY
=========================

Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-01-27
Duration: ~2 hours

DELIVERABLES
------------
✅ REPORT.md (21KB) - Comprehensive audit report
✅ GAPS.md (21KB) - 8 gaps with evidence and fixes
✅ SELF_REVIEW.md (9KB) - 12-dimension self-assessment
✅ LINK_MAP.md (9KB) - Optional internal link analysis

KEY FINDINGS
------------
🛑 BLOCKER: 184 broken internal links (20.6% link failure rate)
   - 129 absolute path links (should be relative)
   - 40 directory links (should link to files)
   - 8 broken anchors (heading format mismatches)
   - 4 line number anchors (GitHub-style, non-standard)
   - 3 missing relative files

⚠️  MAJOR: Exit code conflict between specs and docs
   - Spec: validation failure = exit 2
   - Docs: validation failure = exit 1
   - Must harmonize (specs are authority)

⚠️  MAJOR: Missing contributor guidance
   - schemas/README.md (how to add schemas)
   - reports/README.md (report structure)
   - CONTRIBUTING.md minimal (needs expansion)
   - docs/README.md (docs navigation)

✅ STRENGTHS:
   - Naming conventions consistent (taskcards, specs, schemas)
   - Template consistency excellent (taskcards follow contract)
   - Indexes accurate and complete (specs/README, INDEX, STATUS_BOARD)
   - No unowned TODOs (all are templates/examples)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
Priority 1 (BLOCKER): Fix 184 broken links
Priority 2 (MAJOR): Resolve exit code conflict
Priority 3 (MAJOR): Add missing contributor documentation

OVERALL SCORE: C
Reason: Strong organization but 184 broken links hurt professionalism

REMEDIATION EFFORT: 9-15 hours estimated

TOOLING
-------
Created reusable link checking tools:
- temp_link_checker.py (comprehensive link validator)
- temp_analyze_broken_links.py (categorization)
- Results: temp_link_check_results.json

REPOSITORY NOT READY FOR GO-LIVE until L-GAP-001 (broken links) resolved.
