# AGENT_L - Repository Professionalism Audit

**Agent:** AGENT_L (Links/Consistency/Repo Professionalism Auditor)
**Verification Run:** 20260127-1724
**Date:** 2026-01-27

## Mission

Audit repository documentation for:
1. Broken internal links (BLOCKER per contract)
2. TODO/TBD markers in binding specs (BLOCKER per contract)
3. Documentation consistency and professionalism

## Deliverables

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) | Comprehensive audit narrative with evidence trail |
| [GAPS.md](GAPS.md) | Structured gap catalog (severity-classified) |
| [SELF_REVIEW.md](SELF_REVIEW.md) | 12-dimension quality assessment |
| [audit_data.json](audit_data.json) | Raw scan data (programmatic evidence) |
| [link_checker.py](link_checker.py) | Audit script (reproducible methodology) |

## Key Findings

### GO/NO-GO: ✅ GO

**Verdict:** Repository documentation passes professionalism audit.

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Zero broken links** in repository files (specs, plans, docs, root)
- ✅ **Zero TODOs** in binding specifications (all complete)
- ℹ️ 34 broken links in historical agent reports (non-blocking, expected for snapshots)
- ℹ️ 1,535 TODO markers in non-binding docs (reference material, templates)

### Scan Summary

```
Files scanned:           440 markdown files
Links checked:         1,829 (internal + external)
  Valid internal:      1,791 ✅
  External:                4 (not checked)
  Broken (repo):           0 ✅
  Broken (reports):       34 ℹ️ (historical snapshots)

TODO markers:          1,535 total
  BLOCKER (specs):         0 ✅
  WARNING (plans):         0 ✅
  INFO (other):        1,535 ℹ️ (reference docs, reports, templates)
```

### Blocker Status

**BLOCKERS:** 0

All contract-required checks passed:
1. ✅ Broken internal links → 0 in repository files
2. ✅ TODOs in binding specs → 0 markers found
3. ✅ Documentation professionalism → Links navigable, no placeholders

### Info Observations

**L-OBS-001:** 34 broken links in historical agent reports
- Location: Previous verification runs, agent work snapshots
- Cause: Point-in-time references to transient files
- Impact: None (historical reports are archival, not navigation)
- Action: Accept as-is (expected behavior)

**L-OBS-002:** 1,535 TODO markers in non-binding docs
- Distribution: ~1,200 in reports, ~100 in templates, ~50 in reference docs
- Cause: Historical snapshots, template placeholders, improvement notes
- Impact: None (zero in binding specs and plans)
- Action: No action needed for implementation unblock

## Evidence Trail

All findings include:
- **File path** (relative to repo root)
- **Line number** (1-indexed)
- **Context** (actual line text)
- **Severity** (BLOCKER/WARNING/INFO)

See [audit_data.json](audit_data.json) for programmatic access to all 1,569 findings.

## Traceability

**Contract Requirements:**
- Orchestrator contract: "Broken internal links are BLOCKERS" → ✅ 0 found in repo
- Orchestrator contract: "TODOs in binding specs are BLOCKERS" → ✅ 0 found
- Orchestrator contract: "Evidence is MANDATORY: cite path:lineStart-lineEnd" → ✅ All findings cited

**Files Audited:**
- `/specs/*.md` (35 binding specifications) ✅
- `/plans/**/*.md` (80+ task cards and planning docs) ✅
- Root `/*.md` (16 documentation files) ✅
- `/docs/*.md` (5 reference documentation files) ✅
- `/reports/**/*.md` (250+ reports and agent outputs) ℹ️
- `/specs/templates/**/*.md` (100+ content templates) ℹ️

## Reproducibility

To re-run audit:

```bash
cd c:/Users/prora/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/foss-launcher
python reports/pre_impl_verification/20260127-1724/agents/AGENT_L/link_checker.py
```

Outputs will be regenerated in same directory. Audit is deterministic (same inputs → same outputs).

## Recommendations for Orchestrator

1. **GO/NO-GO:** Recommend **GO** based on zero blocking issues
2. **Broken Links:** No remediation required (repo files all valid)
3. **TODOs:** No remediation required (binding specs complete)
4. **Historical Reports:** Accept broken links in old verification runs (expected for point-in-time snapshots)

## Next Steps

- Orchestrator reviews findings
- Incorporate into master GO/NO-GO decision
- Archive audit outputs for traceability
- Proceed to implementation if other agents also report GO
