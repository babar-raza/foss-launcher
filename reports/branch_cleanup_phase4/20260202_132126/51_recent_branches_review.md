# Recent Branches Review

## Branches Created After Consolidation Started

### feat/tc902_hygiene_20260201 & feat/tc902_w4_impl_20260201
- Date: 2026-02-01 15:24:51
- HEAD commit: d1d440f
- Status: SUPERSEDED

Both branches are identical and at commit d1d440f "fix: Add TC-900 to INDEX.md"

These branches represent an incomplete state of TC-902 work. The feat/golden-2pilots-20260201 branch (already merged) contains:
- d1d440f (from tc902 branches)  
- 6f82d6d feat: Integrate TC-900, TC-901, TC-903 (TC-902 incomplete)
- fe58cc1 feat: Complete TC-902 implementation and fix TC-901/TC-903 hygiene

**Conclusion**: No merge needed - work already included via feat/golden-2pilots-20260201
